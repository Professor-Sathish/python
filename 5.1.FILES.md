### What are files? 
*A file is sequential stream of bytes ending with an end-of-file marker. As we know, at the time of execution, every program is executed in the main memory. Main memory is volatile and the data would be lost once the program is terminated. If we need the same data again, we have to store the data in a file on the disk.
